# Astronomy Projects for Amateurs
#### 11th Executive Committee 
#### Copernicus Astronomical Memorial of SUST

Under the 11th Executive Committee's Research and Project Sector we managed to arrange three projects for amatuer astronomers. 15 selected participants were divided into three teams. They were instructed about the theoretical background of their corresponding project and then how to implement the theory using Python programming language. 
 

#### `Project 1: Measuring Galaxy Distance Using Spectra Data`

`Mentor`: K M Shariat Ullah <br>
`E-mail`: cast.shariat@gmail.com <br>
`Team members`: Bayozid Hossen, Md. Iftekhar Hossain Simanto, Mohiuddin Hajary Jony, Nafis Shyan <br>

`Description`: The project focuses on finding the distance using spectra data of a galaxy. Due to the expansion of the universe the galaxies are getting away from us and it causes a red shift which can be observed using the spectra of the galaxy. We use this red shift to calculate the distance of the galaxy.


#### `Project 2: Astronomical Image Processing and Noise Reduction`

`Mentor`: Tanmoy Bhowmik <br>
`E-mail`: tanmoybhowmik72@gmail.com <br>
`Team members`: Israt Jahan, Kazi Nusrat Tasneem, MD Fardin Islam, Rantideb Roy, Rownok Shahariar <br>

`Description`: The project focuses on the python based analysis, processing and visualization of astronomical data collected from various sources. The project's aim is to integrate image from multiple wavelength based filter such as X-ray, Infrared and visible light (RGB) filter to create composite images and visualizations that provide a more comprehensive understanding of astronomical image processing and noise reduction. <br>


#### `Project 3: Exploring Evolutionary Track of Individual Stars with Aperture Photometry`

`Mentor`: Nusrath Jahan <br>
`E-mail`: numjahan@gmail.com <br>
`Team members`:  Abantika Maytra Oishee, Dibbendu Barua, Manam Ahmed <br>

`Description`:  This project will show how aperture photometry works and how flux of an astronomical object can be measured with this process. Our main objective is to find out if we take the total flux of a star, can we infer the starâ€™s evolutionary stage from that.
